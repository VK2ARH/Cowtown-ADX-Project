# Cowtown Amateur Radio Club -ADX-Project
This repository has been created to host files and resources that were used in the Cowtown ADX project - a Buildathon Project which built the ADX Digital HF tranceiver

The ADX was designed by Barb WB2CBA see his GitHub site for files and details of the project : https://github.com/WB2CBA/ADX. 
Original files, for PCB's and other technical information should be obtained from Barb's GitHub site. This site holds the files and documentation to assist Amateur Radio Clubs or individuals seeking to establish a 'Buildathon' project for the ADX.
Primary Files of interest will be:

- ADX Order Spreadsheet - this sheet provides a detailed parts list of components for the ADX and provides links to where the Cowtown Amateur Radio Club purchased the components as part of a Group Buy.
- The Cowtown ADX Construction Manual developed for the project, and updated during and after the project with lessons learnt.
- The ADX firmware to support seven band operation.
  
Files will be added progressively as they are edited and improved.
