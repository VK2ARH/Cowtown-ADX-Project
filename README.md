# Cowtown Amateur Radio Club: ADX-Project
This repository has been created to host files and resources used in the Cowtown ADX project - a Buildathon Project which built the ADX Digital Mode HF tranceiver

The ADX was designed by Barb WB2CBA see his GitHub site for files and details of the project : https://github.com/WB2CBA/ADX. 

Original files for the PCB's and other technical information can be obtained from Barb's GitHub site. This site holds the files and documentation to assist Amateur Radio Clubs or individuals seeking to establish a 'Buildathon' project for the ADX.
Primary Files of interest will be:

- ADX Order Spreadsheet - this sheet provides a detailed parts list of components for the ADX and supporting sheets to assist in administering a group buy. The sheet includes links to where the Cowtown Amateur Radio Club purchased components as part of their Group Buy.
- The Cowtown ADX Construction Manual developed for the project and updated during and after the project with lessons learnt.
- The ADX firmware to support seven band operation. A video explaining the operation of the additional band selection can be found here: https://youtu.be/Cs5FBKQixyk   Thanks to Randy K5MW for tidying up my code modifications to the original firmware.
  
Files will be added progressively to this site as they are edited and improved, along with any further updates as club members learn and develop their ADX and develop solutions and accessories for use with it.

There are a further two videos available on the Cowtown Amateur Radio Club YouTube Channel:
- The first introducing the ADX ahead of our Buildathon Event. https://youtu.be/zcXAYpAbgKU . This video also shows the operation of the ADX as well as a brief outline of the build process.
- The second discussing the Buildathon, how we went about it and the success we achieved. https://youtu.be/VrkioM_xv6s

Good luck with your project.
