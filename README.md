# June 2025 Update
Latest addition to the Construction Manual to v1.7.1 provides details of the LPF's for 160m which whilst not included in the standard 7 band LPF kit, can be manufactured using a standard LPF PCB. The gerbers for the LPF PCB's can be found at Barb WB2CBA's github site shown below. I put together a short 7 min video highlighting the 160m LPF and operation of the ADX on 160m including the firmware upgrade which can be found here: https://youtu.be/DkK4gmk82t8?si=xi9hO9INV6UPa6VT. 

The software to support the 8 Band version (which includes the 160m Band) has been uploaded into the Software Folder.

# May 2025 Updates
Latest addition updates the Construction Manual to v1.7 incorporates learnings gained from the Cowtown and MWRS buildathons and correcting the error in the number of L2 windings for the LPR. The manual from 1.6 onwards includes additional tuning and testing information which avoids the need to download additional documents from this repository to support a build. The construction manual has been updated to support the Radio and Electonics Association of Southern Tasmania (REAST) build in March 2025. This includes the use of the 7 band variant, a newly designed top cover and the 7 band LPF kit.

The firware has been upgraded to include 8 bands with 160m added. This is indicated by three LED's being illuminated during band configuration mode representing 160m. As there appears to be no published FT4 frequency on 160m this mode is not available when selecting 160m as the band and FT8 Mode 'slot' defaults to FT8 and indicates that in the MODE LED's accordingly. Details of the LPF for 160m will be published shortly.

I have also produced three support videos dealing with:
- Fine tuning the ADX by calibrating the VFO,
- Tuning the LPF's to optimize power out and efficiency, and
- Operating the ADX,  Changing Mode and Band Selection.

These videos can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/@richardh3675 

A Gerber folder has been added which houses the Gerber files to enable production of the PCB's used in Ver 1.6.1 of the construction manual.

# Cowtown Amateur Radio Club: ADX-Project
This repository was initially created to host files and resources used in the Cowtown ADX project - a Buildathon Project which built the ADX Digital Mode HF tranceiver

The ADX was designed by Barb WB2CBA see his GitHub site for files and details of the project : https://github.com/WB2CBA/ADX. Together with further information and discussion here: https://antrak.org.tr/blog/adx-arduino-digital-transceiver/ .

Original files for the PCB's and other technical information can be obtained from Barb's GitHub site. This site holds the files and documentation to assist Amateur Radio Clubs or individuals seeking to establish a 'Buildathon' project for the ADX.
Primary Files of interest will be:

- ADX Order Spreadsheet - this sheet provides a detailed parts list of components for the ADX and supporting sheets to assist in administering a group buy. The sheet includes links to where the Cowtown Amateur Radio Club purchased components as part of their Group Buy.
- The Cowtown ADX Construction Manual developed for the project and updated during and after the project with lessons learnt.
- The ADX firmware to support seven band operation. A video explaining the operation of the additional band selection can be found here: https://youtu.be/wopEhwwN50A   Thanks to Randy K5MW for tidying up my code modifications to the original firmware.
  
Files will be added progressively to this site as they are edited and improved, along with any further updates as club members learn and develop their ADX and develop solutions and accessories for use with it.

There are a further two videos available on the Cowtown Amateur Radio Club YouTube Channel:
- The first introducing the ADX ahead of our Buildathon Event. https://youtu.be/zcXAYpAbgKU . This video also shows the operation of the ADX as well as a brief outline of the build process.
- The second discussing the Buildathon, how we went about it and the success we achieved. https://youtu.be/VrkioM_xv6s

This project was run by the Manly-Warringah Radio Society in June 2024 and Simon Mitchell VK2YU produced a 3D printed enclosure for the ADX - details can be found here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6675282. Some web coverage of the event can be found here: https://www.mwrs.org.au/2024/06/26/june-2024-adx-buildathon/

Good luck with your project.
